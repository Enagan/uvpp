# uvpp - A modern c++ wrapper over libuv

Uvpp aims to be a header-only, modern c++ wrapper for libuv concepts and functionality. It's a product from my frustration of attempting to work with the c-styled libuv library in a modern c++ environment.
Such as it is, modules are developed on a need to use basis. As I need to delve into more and more parts of libuv, uvpp will naturally be improved

## Uvpp currently works with:

- uv_tcp & uv_udp, including the acceptors for tcp connections.
- uv_timer
- uv_work

## Requirements

- libuv, obviously

## Usage Examples

- Coming Soon!
